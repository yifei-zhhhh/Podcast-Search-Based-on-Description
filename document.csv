tex6bgab,Year of Polygamy Podcast,"The series follows the Mormon faith through the lens of “The Principle of Plural Marriage” from its genesis in 1831 with its originator Joseph Smith, through the hidden history and governmental pressure, to today and contemporary practicing Fundamentalist Mormons. For the first time polygamy is dissected through a feminist viewpoint, with attention given to the experiences of the women, women who sacrificed everything and suffered long and are never mentioned in museums or landmark tours. Their experiences, along with interviews with experts, sc20140302_130747holars, historians, and those still affected directly by the practice, paint a new portrait of how the west was shaped, by the hard work and toil of these invisible women, hidden away through controversy. Through Hansen’s careful work, we see how the practice of polygamy affected every aspect of the LDS church’s formation and is still a shadow hanging over the church, visible in it’s approach to marriage, the role of women, and the temple ceremonies. Instead of the historical footnote polygamy is often treated as, Hansen shows how this practice, started in secret and a direct cause of Joseph Smith’s death, responsible for driving the saints to Utah, and then outward again to Mexico and Canada, the root of power struggles both in the church and out, the cause of suspicion and eventually violence including the Mountain Meadows Massacre, was an instigator to most of the history of American West. For the first time, The Year of Polygamy shows how the west was settled not only to claim land and mineral rights, but in a very real way to control the bodies and sexuality of women in a way that reverberates today.

cijyfa4j,Accused,"Binge all of Season 4 early and ad-free by subscribing to Wondery+.Season 4: When Rhoda Nathan's lifeless body was discovered in her hotel room, it was assumed she'd had a heart attack. The autopsy proved otherwise: Nathan, 67, had been viciously beaten to death, punched so hard by her assailant that two of her teeth had been knocked out. Days later, a hotel employee went to the hospital to be treated for an infection in his hand, which was teeming with a bacteria most often found in human mouths. That, plus a pendant an officer said was discovered in the trunk of his car, sealed the fate of Elwood Jones, who awaits execution on Ohio's death row. For nearly 30 years, Jones has maintained his innocence -- and accused police of straight-up framing him. The journalists of Accused are reexamining the case to learn if Jones truly belongs on death row, or if a botched investigation let someone else get away with murder.Season 3: In 1984, a father of three disappeared while working at a mysterious Cincinnati plant. It turned out he’d met a gruesome fate: Pieces of bone, his eyeglasses and walkie-talkie were uncovered inside a vat that reached 1350 degrees Fahrenheit. Two months later, the Fernald Feed Materials Production Center was revealed to have been processing uranium – and polluting the region. The dead man’s children believe their father was murdered because he intended to expose how the plant had been releasing millions of pounds of uranium dust into the atmosphere. We’re hoping to figure out: Did 39-year-old David Bocks kill himself, as Fernald officials alleged, or was he more likely killed?Season 2: A soft-hearted prison minister was found killed in her Kentucky apartment, and Newport police zeroed in on an ex-convict she’d counseled. Thirty years later, the conviction is overturned and the case is once again unsolved. The Cincinnati Enquirer investigates: Was William Virgil wrongly convicted for murder?Season 1: When Elizabeth Andes was found murdered in her Ohio apartment in 1978, police and prosecutors decided within hours it was an open-and-shut case.

01wsevuu,CBS Radio Mystery Theater,"CBS Radio Mystery Theater (a.k.a. Radio Mystery Theater and Mystery Theater, sometimes abbreviated as CBSRMT) was a radio drama series created by Himan Brown that was broadcast on CBS Radio Network affiliates from 1974 to 1982, and later in the early 2000s was carried by the NPR satellite feed.The format was similar to that of classic old time radio shows like The Mysterious Traveler and The Whistler, in that the episodes were introduced by a host (E. G. Marshall) who provided pithy wisdom and commentary throughout. Unlike the hosts of those earlier programs, Marshall is fully mortal, merely someone whose heightened insight and erudition plunge the listener into the world of the macabre (in a manner similar to that of ""The Man in Black"" on yet another old time radio program, Suspense).As with Himan Brown's prior Inner Sanctum Mysteries, each episode of CBS Radio Mystery Theater opened and closed with the ominous sound of a creaking crypt door, accompanied by Marshall's disturbing utterance, ""Come in!… Welcome. I'm E. G. Marshall."" This was followed by one of Marshall's other catchphrases, usually either ""The sound of suspense"" or ""The fear you can hear."" At the conclusion, the door would swing shut, preceded by Marshall's classic sign off, ""Until next time, pleasant… dreams?"" Marshall hosted the program from January 1974 until February 1982, when actress Tammy Grimes took over for the series' last season, maintaining the format.CBSRMT was broadcast each weeknight, at first with a new program each night. Later in the run three or four episodes were new originals each week, and the remainder repeats. There were 1,399 original episodes. The total number of broadcasts, including reruns, was 2,969. Each episode was allotted a full hour of airtime, but after commercials and news, episodes typically ran for about 45 minutes.",Fiction,4.6,241

rfwzj1at,Sustainable Minimalists,"Creating eco-minimalist, non-toxic homes (without the extra work).Although minimalism has experienced a rebirth in recent years, the ""less is more"" movement has been around for centuries. Yet today's minimalist influencers have resurrected minimalism with a decidedly consumerist spin, as modern minimalism is nearly synonymous with decluttering. While there's a lot of chatter about tidying, it's radio silence and crickets when it comes to sustainability. The result? Aspiring minimalists find themselves on an endless hamster wheel of buying, decluttering, buying more, and purging again. Overemphasizing decluttering and underemphasizing the reasons why we overbuy in the first place is thoroughly inconsistent with slow living as a movement; consumption without intention is terrible for the planet, too. Your host, Stephanie Seferian, is a stay-at-home/podcast-from-home mom and author who believes that minimalism, eco-friendliness, and non-toxic living are intrinsically intertwined. She's here to explore the topics of conscious consumerism, sustainability, and environmentally-friendly parenting practices with like-minded women; she's here, too, to show you how to curate eco-friendly, decluttered homes (without the extra work).",Leisure,4.8,636

a18rch1f,"Hope, Through History","Welcome to a new season of the C13Originals critically acclaimed Hope, Through History documentary limited series. Narrated and written by Pulitzer Prize Winning and Best Selling Historian Jon Meacham, Season Two explores some of the most historic and trying times in American History, how this nation dealt with the impact of these moments, and how we came through these moments a more unified nation. Season Two, presented by C13Originals, in association with The HISTORY® Channel, will guide you through the Battle of Gettysburg and its impact on the future of the country, the relationship between FDR and Churchill and America’s slow walk to war, the plan for AIDS relief, the sinking of the Lusitania and events impact on the future of America, and Bloody Sunday and the Voting Rights Act. This follows Season One which covered the 1918 Flu Pandemic, the Great Depression, World War II, the polio epidemic and the Cuban Missile Crisis. These stories of crisis—the term originates in the writings of Hippocrates, as a moment in the course of a disease where a patient either lives or dies—are rich, and in our own 2021 hour of coming out of the devastating pandemic and slow-motion but indisputably real panic, there’s utility in re-engaging with the stories of how leaders and citizens have reacted amid tension and tumult. The vicissitudes of history always challenge us in new and often-confounding ways; that’s in the nature of things. Still, as Winston Churchill once remarked, “The future is unknowable, but the past should give us hope”—the hope that human ingenuity, reason, and character can combine to save us from the abyss and keep us on a path, in another phrase of Churchill’s, to broad, sun-lit uplands.",History,4.6,4000

Maya is no stranger to change. “My whole childhood revolved around the violin, but that changed in a moment when I injured my hand playing a single note,” says Shankar, who was studying under Itzhak Perlman at the Juilliard School at the time. “I was forced to try and figure out who I was, and who I could be, without the violin."" Maya soon discovered a new path in the field of cognitive science, where she earned her PhD as a Rhodes Scholar studying how and why we change. Her insights into human behavior ultimately led her to create A Slight Change of Plans—Apple Podcasts’ Best Show of the Year in 2021. You’ll hear intimate conversations with people like Tiffany Haddish, Kacey Musgraves, and Riz Ahmed, as well as real-life inspirations, like John Elder Robison, who undergoes experimental brain stimulation to deepen his emotional intelligence, Daryl Davis, a Black jazz musician who inspires hundreds of KKK members to leave the Klan, and Shankar herself, who had her own “slight change of plans” earlier this year. The show also explores the science of change with experts like Adam Grant and Angela Duckworth. ""What I love most about this show is that the content is evergreen,"" says Shankar. ""You can listen to episodes in any order and at any time.""",Society & Culture,4.7,1700

zq387qo8,What About Holly‪?‬,"It was a January afternoon in 1981 when a man’s German Shepherd came upon a grisly discovery in the woods outside of Houston: the badly decomposed remains of a young man, beaten to death, and a woman, who was strangled. For 40 years, the victims were nameless – until late 2021, when a team of genetic genealogists identified the pair as 21-year-old Harold Dean Clouse and 17-year-old Tina Gail Clouse, a married couple who had moved from Florida to Texas with their infant daughter. But the discovery of the identities only deepened the mystery: who killed the couple and why? And where is their daughter, Holly, who would be 42 years old if alive today? In this multi-part true crime podcast, host Cristina Corbin travels across the country to interview law enforcement and family members, uncover new leads and speak exclusively with a religious cult at the center of this double murder mystery. The first reporter to obtain the entire police case file, including autopsy reports and crime scene photos, Corbin exposes stunning details that move this decades-old case forward.",True Crime,4.3,165

Are you tired of your limiting beliefs and self-doubt affecting every aspect of your life? You deserve to live an abundant life, you deserve to desire and achieve all of your dreams, and most importantly, you deserve to embody unshakable self-confidence.Believe it or not, I didn’t always embody self-trust. Most of my life, I lived at the mercy of what other people thought of me. It was only during a very low point I experienced during grad school where I asked myself, “Where does your need for perfectionism come from?”This was a game-changing moment for me. For the first time in my life, I asked myself about the origins of my behavior instead of blaming myself for them. From then on, I promised to live out my passion and mission for embodying my true essence and to teach others to do the same.That’s exactly why I created this podcast. This podcast is all about helping you shift from shame, people-pleasing, codependency, low self-esteem, and self-doubt and into alignment, expansion, and unapologetic self-trust through spirituality and healing the inner-child.

l565gha4,Audio Ground School by Part Time Pilot,"Welcome to the Part Time Pilot Audio Ground School Podcast! This podcast is going to be all about providing student pilots with ANOTHER way that they can consume the Private Pilot curriculum. Each episode is myself, Nick Smith, going through the lessons of our Online Ground School but adding more detail, stories and metaphors to make it consumable in the audio format. The #1 reason student pilots never end up becoming a private pilot is NOT due to money. The real reason is actually deeper than that. Yes, flight training is expensive. But every student pilot knows this and budgets for it when they decide to do it.The actual #1 reason a student pilot fails is because they do not have a good, fundamental understanding of the private pilot knowledge they are meant to learn in ground school. You see when a student does not have a good grasp of this knowledge they get to a point in their flight training where their mind just can’t keep up. They start making mistakes and having to redo lessons. And THAT is when it starts getting too expensive. This audio ground school is meant for the modern day student pilot... aka the part time student pilot. Let’s face it, the majority of us have full time responsibilities on top of flight training. Whether it is a job, kids, family, school, etc. we all keep ourselves busy with the things that are important to us. And with today’s economy we have to maintain that job just to pay for the training. The modern day student pilot is busy, on the go and always trying to find time throughout his or her day to stay up on their studies. The audio ground school allows them to consume high quality content while walking, running, working out, sitting in traffic, traveling, or even just a break from the boring FAR/AIM or ground school lecture. Did I meant high quality content? The audio ground school is taken straight out of the 5-star rated Part Time Pilot Online Ground School that has had over 350 students take and pass their Private Pilot exams without a SINGLE STUDENT FAILING. We do this by keeping ground school engaging, fun, light and consumable. We have written lessons, videos, audio lessons, live video lessons, community chats, quizzes, practice tests, flash cards, study guides, eBooks and much more. Part Time Pilot was created to be a breath of fresh air for student pilots. To be that flight training provider that looks out for them and their needs. So that is just what we are doing with this podcast.",Leisure,4.9,27

But that anonymity comes at a cost: Cosima is unable to pursue the cutting-edge science that saved her life; Sarah’s daughter Kira is suffocated by her mother’s insistence on secrecy; and Charlotte, the youngest Leda clone, questions why her family gets to survive while other, unaware clones get sick and die. Everything changes when Vivi Valdez, a CIA Agent, discovers she, too, is a clone—and goes rogue. Vivi’s pursuit of the truth brings chaos to the original Clone Club when one of them is accused of murder. To prove their innocence, they must step out of the shadows and publicly claim the secret they’ve sacrificed everything to protect. Family ties will be tested, long-lasting alliances betrayed, and the future of all clones hangs in the balance.Season 2 picks up where Season 1 leaves off, with (spoiler alert!) the Clones exposed to the general public. Now that the news is out, hundreds of previously unaware clones strive for justice and clash with anti-clone protestors. In the middle of it all, the Sestras and their families wrestle with the consequences of their actions, and what it means for their future.  Emmy Award-winning Orphan Black actress Tatiana Maslany returns for Season 2, but is now joined by original TV show cast members Jordan Gavaris (Felix), Evelyne Brochu (Delphine), and Kristian Bruun (Donnie). Orphan Black: The Next Chapter is a Realm production written by Malka Older, Madeline Ashby, Mishell Baker, Heli Kennedy, E.C.

He was writing a teenage symphony to God. That album, Smile, was never finished. Instead, Brian slowly unraveled, as the pressure to make something profound weighed heavy on him. He worried that he wasn’t good enough. He worried that he was a failure in the eyes of the record company, his band, his peers, and his own father. He thought his house was bugged. He thought the music he was making conjured some strange voodoo that had a disastrous impact on the real world. He became paranoid. He self-medicated with amphetamines, hash, and LSD. He held meetings in his swimming pool. He imagined people who weren’t there. And eventually, in 1967, he went off the proverbial deep end. Did the real Brian Wilson ever resurface? Part true crime, part historical fiction, part spoken word lo-fi beat noir brought to you by Jake Brennan, and featuring the fictionalized voice Brian Wilson, BLOOD ON THE TRACKS sounds like nothing you’ve heard before.

And chances are, you’re one of them — whether you’re dealing with anxiety, depression, endometriosis, pcos, acne, eczema, psoriasis, autoimmune, thyroid conditions, lyme disease, brain fog, or fatigue. You’re far from alone. Living with symptoms has become the new normal. Much of the time, people coexist with their ailments, accepting them and never questioning why science and research hasn’t offered answers, as suffering has become the status quo. Sometimes though — an increasing amount of the time now — people’s symptoms start to impede their quality of life. They start to lose joys and privileges. They join the hidden army of those stuck at home or even in the hospital with mystery health issues. As they consult doctor after doctor and expert after expert and have trouble functioning on a day to day basis, their spark starts to go. They lose hope. No one is safe from becoming ill. With what were up against in today’s world and what that’s doing to our bodies, nobody is guaranteed that one day down the road, they won’t develop their first set of symptoms when they least expect it.

Our ancestors may have been aware of these impending disasters and fled underground shelter, or survived in caves; others may have left the planet, but a huge number perished.

The second time, it was extortion, demanding the Ukrainian government manufacture dirt on Trump’s political opponents in exchange for help the country needs to fend off a Russian invasion and chart a democratic future free of Vladimir Putin’s Kremlin.  To make sense of these recent events that have rocked American politics and led to very real concerns that the President of the United States may be a Russian asset, we need to dig a little deeper. In Season 1, The Asset dives into Trump’s decades-long history with Russia, from his extensive business dealings with Russian oligarchs to his presidential campaign and the investigations that have sent some of his closest associates to prison.In Season 2, The Asset explores the backstory to Trump’s infamous phone call with the newly-elected Ukrainian President, where he demanded an investigation into a political opponent and set off a series of events leading to the impeachment inquiry.Hosted by Max Bergmann, a senior fellow and director of the Moscow Project at the Center for American Progress Action Fund, and featuring expert guests, The Asset will put together the pieces of Trump’s relationship with Russia and Ukrainian extortion campaign.The Asset is a partnership between the Center for American Progress Action Fund, District Productive, and Protect the Investigation.

Every month, a new audio series will bring you to the edge of your seat — and keep you there. With episodes dropping twice a week, you’ll never be without something to keep the adrenaline flowing.Whether you’re uncovering the secret of disappearing ships in the Bermuda Triangle, or in the race of your life against time and your evil doppelgänger, you may want to watch your back, as things are not always as they seem. The suspense and excitement of ADRENALINE will show that fight or flight are not the only options in the face of danger. Sometimes you just need to keep listening…This month, we are featuring a story called Overleaper, starring BAFTA and Emmy-nominated actress Thora Birch, which follows an American soldier who must stop her doppelganger from a parallel dimension who’s taken her place, with plans to assassinate the President of the United States.  Special Forces Staff Sergeant Audrey Beach is a determined career soldier, rising through the ranks to the cream of the military crop. She doesn’t have much else in life besides her daughter Lydia, who lives with her ex-husband after a difficult divorce. But Audrey’s training could never prepare her for a top-secret mission in Afghanistan’s Herat Province, where she faces the impossible: her own doppelgänger from another universe locking her up and leaving her to die…and taking Audrey’s place in the process.  The Overleaper is Audrey, but in her timeline, she has suffered far worse pain. Lydia is dead— murdered in a tragic military mishap— and her quest for revenge led her to sacrifice her loyalty to the United States. A dangerous country in her dimension has aided the Overleaper’s vengeful mission, for a price: replace the Audrey Beach in our world and assassinate the President, no matter the personal price. With nothing left to live for, the Overleaper agrees. To defend the nation and protect her good name, Audrey must escape Afghanistan and traverse the globe, evading US authorities and international spies in order to thwart the Overleaper’s plan.  Overleaper is a Realm production, written by Sam Boush.

arczqdza,After Trump,"What will be Donald Trump's lasting effects on American politics and the presidency?Trump operated the presidency in ways that defied widely held assumptions about how a president might use and abuse the powers of the office. His mercurial personality, pathological mendacity, shamelessness, open disrespect for law and norms, vicious attacks on officials and institutions, intermingling of public and private interest, and indifference to facts did enormous damage to the great office that he assumed on January 20, 2017. And his words and actions exposed the presidency’s vulnerability to dangerous excesses of authority and dangerous weaknesses in accountability. Trump was not the first president to raise these dangers, obviously, but he did so unlike any of his predecessors.Reconstructing the presidency will require much more than the right attitude by the president and senior executive branch officials. It will also require a comprehensive examination of the many fissures in the structure of the office that a future president might choose to exploit in a fashion similar to Trump.Over six episodes, Host Virginia Heffernan, outlines with Lawfare's Jack Goldsmith & former White House Counsel Bob Bauer outline their proposal of reform to our government in the fallout of the Trump Administration.

k0mdkews,The Unauthorized History of the Pacific War,"The Pacific theater of World War II…scene of some of the bloodiest, most violent fighting in history.  Nations locked in a fight to the death, in a total war that would kill millions and devastate landscapes and civilizations across the largest battle front in human history.    A war which, for the United States, started on a peaceful Sunday morning and ended four and half years later under the shadow of nuclear weapons.  A war in which tactics and doctrine was written, rewritten and tested on a scale never seen before or since, yet is often overshadowed by the European theater that occurred at the same time.  The winds of war may be blowing in the Pacific again today, and that makes what happened there in the 20th Century even more relevant. Hello everyone, I’m Seth Paridon, WWII historian and museum professional with nearly 20 years worth of experience and research into the Pacific theater. And I’m William Toti, retired Navy captain who steamed the very same Pacific waters for over a decade where so many of our great World War II battles were fought. Bill and I are kicking off a new podcast about the Pacific Theater of Operations during World War II, titled “An Unauthorized History of the Pacific War."" In this podcast we will be covering the war from an angle you might not be familiar with.  For example, many people know about the Guadalcanal campaign, but did you know that twice as many sailors died in that campaign as Marines? We will also cover the great leaders of the Pacific theater, bringing to light some facts you might not be aware of.  For example, a lot of people still consider General Douglas MacArthur to be a hero, but did you know that before the war, at age 50 he took in a 16-year-old mistress?  And during the war he repeatedly changed his operational plans resulting in the needless deaths of thousands of Americans? It’s not our intention to focus on the salacious, but we will expose hard, historical facts that have largely been overlooked by the general public. We hope you will join us and find our take on the Pacific war intriguing.   Again, the name of our podcast is “An Unauthorized History of the Pacific War.  Subscribe to the show wherever you receive your podcasts and follow the video version of our shows on youtube.  We hope to see you soon.",History,4.9,11

h6h7j34e,Gunsmoke,"In the late 1940s, CBS chairman William S. Paley, a fan of the Philip Marlowe radio series, asked his programming chief, Hubell Robinson, to develop a hardboiled Western series, a show about a ""Philip Marlowe of the Old West"". Robinson instructed his West Coast CBS Vice President, Harry Ackerman, who had developed the Philip Marlowe series, to take on the task.Ackerman and his scriptwriters, Mort Fine and David Friedkin, created an audition script called ""Mark Dillon Goes to Gouge Eye"" based on one of their Michael Shayne radio scripts, ""The Case of the Crooked Wheel"" from the summer of 1948. Two versions were recorded. The first, recorded in June 1949, was very much like a hardboiled detective series and starred Michael Rye (credited as Rye Billsbury) as Dillon; the second, recorded in July 1949, starred Straight Arrow actor Howard Culver in a more Western, lighter version of the same script. CBS liked the Culver version better, and Ackerman was told to proceed.A complication arose, though; Culver's contract as the star of Straight Arrow would not allow him to do another Western series. The project was shelved for three years when producer Norman Macdonnell and writer John Meston discovered it while creating an adult Western series of their own.Macdonnell and Meston wanted to create a radio Western for adults, in contrast to the prevailing juvenile fare such as The Lone Ranger and The Cisco Kid. Gunsmoke was set in Dodge City, Kansas, during the thriving cattle days of the 1870s. Dunning notes, ""The show drew critical acclaim for unprecedented realism.""Radio cast and character biographiesThe radio series first aired on CBS on April 26, 1952, with the episode ""Billy the Kid"", written by Walter Newman, and ended on June 18, 1961. The show stars William Conrad as Marshal Matt Dillon, Howard McNear as Doc Charles Adams, Georgia Ellis as Kitty Russell, and Parley Baer as Dillon's assistant, Chester Wesley Proudfoot.",Fiction,4.5,54

His only company on board the station are stern mission chief Minkowski, insane science officer Hilbert, and Hephaestus Station's sentient, often malfunctioning operating system Hera.

gnxr24nr,Good Cult,"River Donaghey grew up in a cult. Or at least that’s what some people called it. His parents called it a “personal-growth seminar group.” Its leader called it “one big happy family.” But there was a dark side to the world River grew up in. One he never heard about as a kid. In the 1970s and 80s, a self-help company called Lifespring took America by storm. Hundreds of thousands of people walked out of Lifespring as true believers, convinced that the seminars had the power to change the world. But dozens of trainees claimed that after taking a seminar, they had a psychotic break. Some spent months in the hospital. Others attempted suicide. And at least four people died. River spent the past year digging into the bizarre, untold story of Lifespring and its controversial leader: a convicted felon turned New Age guru named John Hanley. What he uncovered made him question everything he thought he knew about his childhood. And about the seminars that are still changing lives—and ruining them—to this day.",True Crime,4.8,1000

On Complexified we dive into the places where religion and politics collide with real-life, so we can get unstuck- so we can make real change. We dive into our most entrenched problems to better understand the hidden histories and experiences of real people on the front lines. We look at the ways religion has shaped our systems - and the ways we see ourselves and others–  from there, we work together to imagine new paths forward.",Government,5.0,18

gnbpngef,Echo Park,"James and Terrance share DNA, but they aren’t brothers. They aren’t even friends. As a civil advisor for the LAPD, James relies on Terrance— his genetic clone—to help him pass mandatory drug testing. But when Terrance suddenly goes missing, and multiple clones end up murdered, a case of mistaken identity forces James to inhabit his double’s life, risking that the secret of his addiction will unravel his carefully composed lies.First designed as biotech property and then raised in foster care, Echoes live on the outskirts of society; genetic clones of their sources, but rarely accepted into their lives. That’s what Terrance should have been for James— a stranger he never even knew existed— but instead, their lives became dangerously intertwined. After Terrance misses their usual exchange of clean urine for cash, a man with a gun shows up instead. In order to stay alive, James pretends he’s Terrance, setting off a dangerous chain of events that quickly spiral out of his control. Inhabiting his clone’s life is the easy part; James is used to lying. He’s lied to his traditional, well-off Chinese parents about where he goes at night, to his coworkers at the LAPD about his drug habit, and to Terrance, about how severe his addiction really is. It never occurred to him that Terrance was keeping secrets, too. As he learns about the history of clones, James begins to question the biggest secret of all: the one his parents kept when they, like many others, chose to clone their children. When clones are murdered and James is blackmailed by someone who knows his true identity, finding Terrance becomes only half the mission. Because the clues left in his wake lead to a conspiracy even more cold blooded than murder— and if James can prove it, the lines and lies that divide his world and the clones will be shattered forever.Echo Park is a Realm production starring Harry Shum Jr., written by Curtis C.

942634t2,WTF is on my Mind?‪!‬,"Author, Speaker, Whistleblower and award-winning Director Mark Vicente was behind the sleeper hit “What The Bleep Do We Know?!” Several books have been written about the film’s remarkable grassroots marketing campaign, which led to its unprecedented success.Mark was born in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1965. Taking his first photograph at age four, he quickly discovered his passion for being behind the camera. After attending film and drama school in South Africa, he began working his way up the ranks of the camera department, from Assistant to Operator to Cinematographer. His first big break came as Director of Photography on the musical “SARAFINA,” starring Whoopi Goldberg. In 1992, he set his sights on Hollywood and relocated to Los Angeles to shoot his first studio picture for Disney;  “FATHERHOOD,” starring Patrick Swayze and Halle Berry. At the age of 26, he became one of the youngest cinematographers to shoot a big-budget studio picture. Over the next few decades, he went on to shoot an additional 14 feature films and numerous documentaries, music videos and commercials. Mark soon found there were in him, untold stories he desperately wanted to express as a Director. He was driven by the conviction that tales of greatness, nobility and introspection could be exciting and financially successful. Perhaps because of the very obvious race and class iniquities in South Africa, he found himself propelled to question certain fundamental assumptions at a very young age. Beliefs about human behavior, cosmology, religion, existentialism and mysticism. Along the way, he stumbled into a few situations where leaders with malignant pathologies (masquerading as saintly philosophers) spoke the talk of self-improvement but did untold damage to their followers... and him. Looking back, he can now say he has been in at last two cults. His last foray into personal growth and his defection from NXIVM was chronicled in the HBO series “The Vow”. Mark and a few plucky whistleblowers exposed the criminal activities of the organization, resulting in multiple arrests and indictments. He doesn’t consider himself a cult expert, but by his own admission, “I’m an expert in being screwed over, waking up, and knowing how to spot them.” He’s got a pretty salty approach to most things and is fascinated by the myriad patterns in the human psychodynamic that create the best and the worst in civilization. Join Mark as he unpacks a whole range of topics to do with: Psychology, Consciousness, Morality, Narcissistic Abuse, Spirituality, Cults, Propaganda, Science, Filmmaking, and Philosophy.You never quite know what you’re going to get, as it really does depend on… WTF is on his mind?!",Society & Culture,4.9,299

cz85adrw,The Crappy Childhood Fairy Podcast with Anna Runkle,"I’m Anna Runkle, also known as the Crappy Childhood Fairy, and I teach people to recognize and heal the symptoms of Childhood PTSD. Welcome to my podcast!I’m not a doctor or therapist; I know about childhood trauma because I lived it, and I discovered a radical approach to healing that focuses first on calming neurological dysregulation, which is common in people who grew up with abuse and neglect. In my podcasts, I teach about dysregulation – how to know if you have it, what it can do to your body, your thinking and your relationships, and what to do to master re-regulation. When I learned this, everything in my life got suddenly easier. I’ll also be teaching you to heal the life problems that so often develop after years of living dysregulated – feeling tired, isolated and unfocused, finding yourself always drawn to unavailable and inappropriate partners, and falling WAY short of your professional potential, for example. The thing about me is, traditional therapies never seemed to help me. When I found techniques that did work, my whole life changed. Only in the past few years has the trauma research caught up to explain why – why the techniques I use worked, why therapy didn’t, and why my healing journey was so unnecessarily long. I’ve been teaching what I learned for more than 20 years now. It started with friends who had noticed the quick and dramatic change in me, and gradually grew by word of mouth. In 2016, I had so many people seeking instruction that I made my first online video, and then an online course, and this is how Crappy Childhood Fairy was born. My techniques and principles are practical yet powerful – an approach anyone can use, whether or not you have access to professional help. In this podcast, I’ll be talking about the master of self-regulation, and teach the tough-love life-lessons that you may not have learned at home – like how to date so that stable love finds you, how to get ahead at work, and how to calm the negative hamster-wheel thoughts that block your ability to connect with other people. Today, almost half a million people follow my work and participate in my training and coaching programs. My mission is to change the paradigm of what’s possible for people like us, and to help you free yourself from the oppression of trauma wounds, and to become your full, happy and real self. I’m glad you’re here!

He relates that ""soon the requests began to grow to the point that we knew God was leading us into a wider ministry."" As an extension of Dr. Rogers' pulpit ministry Love Worth Finding provided that role and continues today.Dr. Rogers stated, ""I believe God wants us to proclaim the message of salvation in the power of the Holy Spirit by every means possible. That’s our commitment at Love Worth Finding.""In response to many who are asking,has that purpose changed since the home-going of Dr. Rogers? No, God wants us to continue to proclaim the message of salvation. The messenger may be gone, but the message must continue. Millions still have not heard the precious name of Jesus or know His redeeming grace.So our race is not over. We must still rununtil Jesus comes. If you believe in what God has called LWF to do,we invite you to help us proclaim God's truth.Our prayer is that you will join with us in running the race and in broadcasting the Good News that Jesus Christ is truly the greatest Love worth finding.",Religion & Spirituality,4.9,2000

This moment begs us all to look to our past to help understand our present, and to imagine a better future. In the aftermath of the carnage of the Civil War, the nation struggled to give shape to a country drenched in blood. In many ways, we are still fighting old battles and still trapped in assumptions that blocked the way to imagining a new America. Written and narrated by award-winning author and Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, Dr. Eddie S. Glaude, “History is US” is a 6-part audio documentary produced and developed by C13Originals that asks questions about who we are as a nation, and what race might reveal about our current crisis. Through the voices of distinguished historians and scholars, this limited series gives listeners the background and education to understand how we got here and how we can all use history to clarify the choices before us. “History is US” is a presentation of Shining City Audio, a C13Originals and Jon Meacham Studio.",History,4.7,1100

With our endless topics such as “Caught Cheating,” we pin point situations and stories ranging from people running out of hotels naked as of results of getting caught to a broad spectrum of mental health conversations. This podcast discusses it ALL. We’re all about hearing different perspectives, learning from and being enlightened by one another. Meet the hosts: Terry Roseland is a Chicago kid who grew up in the hood, Roseland to be exact! But that didn’t make him who he was! A popular young man who attended Simeon; he knows people from all different backgrounds, giving him the advantage to relate to those who are not like him, but not much different either. Terry wouldn’t consider himself to be hellbent on education but he surely stuck it out and got that degree! Terry displays that you can overcome your obstacles by any means, getting out of life what you truly know you deserve! Trouble tried to grasp Terry but he came out on top! His life’s ups and downs make it easier to talk to him because he is truly one of the funniest, bluntest and most importantly, non-judgmental people you will ever meet! And saying all of that goes on to say, Terry isn’t much different than Kam!Kam is also a Chicago native, from the south side, who attended Brooks College Prep! Mostly popular for her singing, it’s not ironic that she stands on letting her voice be heard! And she’s definitely a true socialite as well! She tends to relate to everyone, being from a place that will swallow you if you let it! But she always knew she would never allow that to overtake the power she knew she had to be great! She is super humorous, relatable and keeps it real! Nothing is standing in the way of these two as they utilize this podcast to gain an ear from people of all backgrounds, shades and genders! Nothing on this podcast will go unsaid so tune in to her a solid women’s and men’s perspective on all the wild things that happen in life!!Come kick with us every week and follow us on social media @TerryRoseland on all platforms.

Cling on by the last little thread. And at the same time, Carpe Diem - enjoy every moment because it's going to go by so fast. The typical mom culture sends us all kinds of mixed, typically negative messages. We shouldn't take care of ourselves; it's selfish. The more ragged you run yourself, the bigger your badge of honor. But also, ditch your mom bod and work out. Don't yell. Make more money. Show up. Be better, but not at the expense of time with your kids.I am putting a hard stop to all of this. While being a mom, running a business, and whatever else you might have going on is hard, it is a lot and there's lots of giving of yourself, the idea that motherhood means living a joyless, nonstop-hustle-with-zero-balance kind of life, where you give and give and give and never take, needs to stop.I'm on a mission to help you stop counting down the minutes 'til bedtime (at least most days). Stop the mom guilt and shame game. Stop cleaning up after your kids' childhood and start being present for it. I want to help you thrive in work, home, and life. I believe in John 10:10 that we are called to living an abundant life and I know moms are not excluded from that promise. Join me in conversations about simplicity, some business and life hacks, spirituality and lots of other good stuff that leads to a life of less for the sake of enjoying more in your motherhood.

c4vpg8sw,"Motherhood in ADHD – Parenting with ADHD, Productivity Tips, Brain based Science, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder","Productivity, Parenting, and Education for Moms with Adult ADHDAre you overwhelmed by the never-ending to do list of motherhood? Are you burnt out and barely keeping your head above water? Are you confused and frustrated by how all the other moms make it look so easy? And somehow you're still floundering despite trying even harder... Your purse is as overflowing as your mind, you never feel like a good enough mom, and you don't dare have anyone over to visit to witness your messy home. You just want the best for your kids, but you can't figure out how to manage the chaos, both in your mind and in your house.Oh, I've been there, mama. Some days, I'm still there. Parenting with ADHD is hard! We want to be structured for our kids, yet we can't seem to stay consistent even for ourselves. But I'm letting go of everyone else's perception of a ""good mom"" and stepping into loving who I am a little more each day.  Will you join me?Whether you have ADHD like I do, or think you might, here is your permission slip to let go of the pinterest worthy visions of organization and structure fit for everyone else. Let's do life like our brains do life: creatively, lovingly, and with all your might. Moms with ADHD have a superpower of always trying their best, even when it doesn't pan out. How do I know? I have known about my ADD for over twenty years, and I want to share all of this hard-earned ADHD knowledge with you, making your adjustment a lot easier and faster than mine was. What does Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder look like in women? We'll dive into emotional regulation, motivation, executive function, hormones, medication, and natural treatments. Women with ADHD share their diagnosis stories with us, whether inattentive, hyperactive or combined, from childhood through adult diagnoses. We also talk about ADHD's so-called friends like depression, anxiety, addiction, disordered eating, other learning differences, and what I've learned through therapy and CBT.  Science is my jam and learning about how our brains work through the lens of scientific research helps us understand who we are. ADHD is not just for little boys; it looks different in girls. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder is a neurological medical condition, not an excuse for lazy, stupid, unmotivated people to not live up to our potential. Let's agree to throw that thought in the trash.Once we understand how our brains work, we can dive into the practical strategies like structuring our day, minimalism, money, nurturing our relationships, daily rhythms, using a planner, and improving our sleep. I want to help you build your version of a joyful family life.We talk about everything from ADHD to Zebras, because that is how Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder works: to us, our thoughts are clearly connected, but non-linear to everyone else. I want you to love being a zebra in a world full of horses. We were born as unique, gorgeous creatures, not meant to blend in with the usual nor mundane. When we embrace who we are and how our brains work, we can figure out how to live out lives successfully and in turn, lead our families well.At the end of the day, we just want to be good moms.  Spoiler alert: you are already a great mom. If you're ready to see that with your own two eyes, hit play and listen in as we love ourselves a little more each day of our ADHD lives. ADHD does NOT mean you're doomed to be a hot mess, mama! You CAN rewrite your story from shame spiral to success story, and I'll be right here beside you to cheer you on!With love, Patricia Sung, a fellow mama with ADHDFree Resources and Transcriptions at: motherhoodinadhd.comConnect with Patricia Sung on Instagram: www.instagram.com/motherhoodinadhdJoin like-minded mamas in our Motherhood in ADHD Facebook community:  https://www.facebook.com/groups/motherhoodinadhdSign up for classes to learn about ADHD: www.successfulasamother.com",Kids & Family,4.9,127

i70ztypg,X-Ray Vision,"From Emmy-award winner Jason Concepcion and Crooked Media comes X-Ray Vision, a new weekly podcast that transcends pop culture and entertainment by taking listeners from Middle-earth to Waystar Royco, and everything in between. Hold on to your cape as we journey through the zeitgeist-iest (patent pending) of film, TV, and comics– guided by Jason’s one-of-a-kind analysis and expert guests. Test your fandom knowledge with panel discussions on the latest nerd news, casting, and show lore while staying tuned for deep dives into all of your favorite franchises. New episodes released weekly.Editors’ Notes: “There’s not a secret sauce to podcasting, there’s only ever two ingredients: information and entertainment value,” Jason Concepcion tells Apple Podcasts. “Every episode is an attempt to combine those two things in a way that feels true and engages the audience.” In each weekly episode of Crooked Media’s X-Ray Vision, Concepcion and co-hosts Rosie Knight and Cody Ziglar share insightful analysis of the shows, movies, and comic book properties that are dominating the pop culture conversation—whether it's the ever-expanding Marvel cinematic universe, DC Comics fandom, or the latest episode of Succession. Concepcion got his first taste of podcasting when he worked as a Senior Creative for the sports and pop culture website The Ringer. In addition to covering the NBA, he and Mallory Rubin collaborated on Binge Mode, in which they went beyond the surface coverage of phenomena like Game of Thrones and Harry Potter to get deep into the detail and backstory of the original texts. “It was an incredible experience just from a learning standpoint, but also was incredibly fun and gratifying,” he says. “It tapped into just things that I'm passionate about and that I cared about.” While he believes X-Ray Vision is also research-heavy, Concepcion wants to make the show more conversational and doesn't want listeners to feel like they were listening to a Wikipedia article. “We always go into covering something with the idea of respecting the material—which helps in the fact that we’re sincerely passionate about the stuff we like,” he says. “I think one of the most important things, granular knowledge of a topic aside, is making that knowledge accessible.” Jason is also the host of Takeline, a fast-paced exploration of the NBA, world of sports, and pop culture.",TV & Film,4.8,1000
